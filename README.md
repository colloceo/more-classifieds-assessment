##  Design : "Premium Dark"

The redesign moves away from standard flat templates to create an immersive user experience.

### 1. Visual Aesthetics
- **Glassmorphism:** Extensive use of `backdrop-filter: blur()` and semi-transparent layers to create depth and hierarchy.
- **Color Palette:** A deep navy/slate background (`#0f172a`) ensures high contrast against the signature brand orange (`#f65016`).
- **Typography:** **Outfit** sans-serif is used for its geometric, modern appeal.

### 2. Mobile-First Architecture
- **Responsive Grid:** A custom utility-first grid system that transitions fluidly from desktop multi-columns to mobile vertical stacks.
- **Touch Targets:** All form inputs and buttons are optimized for touch interaction on smaller devices.
