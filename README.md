# More Classifieds Redesign (React)

A modern, premium redesign concept for **More.co.ke**, focusing on enhanced user experience, aesthetic brilliance, and robust functionality. This project migrates the core pages to a React-based Single Page Application (SPA).

## 🎨 Design Vision
The redesign shifts from a standard template to a **"Premium Dark"** aesthetic.
- **Glassmorphism**: Subtle transparency and blur effects for a depth-rich UI.
- **Vibrant Accents**: Utilizing the signature brand orange (`#f65016`) for high-contrast call-to-actions.
- **Modern Typography**: Powered by the **Outfit** typeface for a clean, professional feel.
- **3D Assets**: Custom-generated isometric marketplace illustrations.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. Dynamic Registration Flow
- **Split-Screen Layout**: Immersive visual context on desktop, focused form on mobile.
- **Smart Logic**: Form labels and placeholders dynamically switch between "Individual" and "Company" modes.
- **Social Integration**: Ready-to-use UI for Google and Facebook authentication.
- **Advanced UX**: Fixed-height desktop scrolling and intelligent keyboard focus.

### 2. Robust Enquiry System
- **Structured Categories**: Pre-defined departments (Sales, Support, Billing) and regional targeting.
- **Priority Management**: Interactive "Priority Pills" for urgent matter flagging.
- **File Attachments**: Custom-styled file upload interface.
- **Responsive Layout**: Automatically adapts from multi-column grids to readable vertical stacks.

### 3. Fully Mobile Responsive
- Built with a mobile-first approach using flexible CSS Grid utilities.
- Tested across various breakpoints to ensure the "wow" factor persists on all devices.
